# yearbook-server

This is the backend component of my [yearbook app project!](https://github.com/ericx20/yearbook-app)
It's a Node.js server powered by Express and MongoDB! It's the backbone of the project, serving as a REST API for storing and modifying yearbook pages.

The server is close to completion, and I hope to host a live demo of the whole project very soon. Stay tuned!
